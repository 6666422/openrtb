# openrtb-objects
A Javascript library which builds and validates OpenRTB objects. This project was inspired by the good people at [Metamarkets](https://metamarkets.com/) who build a [similar library for Java](https://github.com/metamx/rad-tech-datatypes). 

## Features

- Construct OpenRTB objects
- Validate OpenRTB objects
- Convert objects from native to JSON format

* Note: The objects are based on the latest OpenRTB specification v2.3 but most of them would work for v2.2 too.

## Usage

### Construct a bid request

### Construct a bid response
